# What is a Swing Dancing Exchange?

At exchanges, the focus is on connection, joy, and shared experiences. You'll find numerous opportunities to dance, learn, and meet like-minded people.

Beginners are just as welcome as experienced dancers.

QSXZ combines the exchange format with Zürich Pride and places special emphasis on choosing dance roles freely and flexibly, independent of conventional gender roles.
