# What is a Swing Dancing Exchange?

Never heard of a swing dance exchange? You're not alone! While these events are common in the swing dance world, QSXZ welcomes many people who are discovering both swing dancing and exchanges for the first time—especially during Pride Weekend.

## A Weekend Dance Party & Cultural Experience

A swing dance exchange is a **weekend-long celebration** where dancers travel to experience a different city's unique dance community. Think of it as part dance festival, part cultural immersion, part community gathering.

Unlike competitions or recitals, exchanges are all about **connection, joy, and sharing**. There are no judges, no performances to perfect, no pressure to be the best dancer in the room. Instead, you'll find nearly continuous opportunities to dance, learn, and connect with people from around the world.

## What Actually Happens?

**Daytime:** Workshops and classes where you'll learn new techniques, explore different styles, and meet fellow dancers. Teachers rotate partners constantly, so you'll dance with many different people—perfect for beginners who don't have a partner!

**Evenings:** Social dancing to live bands and DJs, featuring everything from vintage swing jazz to contemporary sounds. Dance as much or as little as you like, take breaks in chill spaces, and enjoy the community atmosphere.

**Between dances:** City tours, brunch gatherings, historical talks, and chances to explore Zürich's queer spaces. At QSXZ, we're also integrating with Pride Weekend events, making this more than just a dance exchange.

**Throughout:** The exchange spirit—local dancers welcome travelers by sharing their city's culture, often hosting visitors in their homes, and creating lasting friendships across borders.

## Hospitality & Community at the Heart

One beautiful tradition of exchanges is **host families**—local dancers who open their homes to traveling participants. It's not just about saving on hotel costs (though that helps!). It's about building real connections, learning about each other's communities, and creating chosen family through dance.

Of course, hotels and other accommodations are always available too. The key is that whatever your situation, you'll feel welcomed into the community.

As with other social dances, **you do not need to come with a partner**. It is quite normal to come to a swing dance event and dance with many different people. **You also do not need to know how to dance Lindy Hop to attend.** We offer workshops for beginners and will get you ready for the party in no time.

## What Makes QSXZ Different?

QSXZ brings the exchange format to Zürich's Pride Weekend with some unique twists:

- **Role-switching focus** (Everyone Leads, Everyone Follows)—learn both dance roles regardless of gender
- **Integration with Pride events**—connect swing dancing with queer culture and activism
- **Multidisciplinary programming**—workshops, drag performances, queer history talks, city exploration
- **Beginner-friendly** with special "taster" classes for Pride attendees new to swing
- **Community-centered**—honoring both the Black roots of lindy hop and its queer history
