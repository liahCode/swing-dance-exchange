# What is Lindy Hop?

## A Dance Born in Harlem's Radical Freedom

Lindy hop is the granddaddy of all swing dances—an improvisational partner dance born in Harlem during the 1920s and 1930s. Created by Black Americans during the Harlem Renaissance, this electrifying dance emerged in legendary spaces like the Savoy Ballroom, where dancers moved to the swinging sounds of big band jazz.

**If you're not Black, you're a guest in this cultural tradition.** We honor that lineage with gratitude and respect.

## Queer Roots, Radical Beginnings

The early swing scene wasn't just Black—it was magnificently queer. Gladys Bentley headlined Harlem nightclubs in the 1930s, performing in a white tuxedo and top hat as an openly lesbian entertainer. Ma Rainey, the "Mother of the Blues," was bisexual and sang openly about same-sex desire. The dance floors where lindy hop flourished were spaces of creative freedom where people could express themselves beyond the rigid gender norms of the era.

These weren't anomalies—they were the culture. Original lindy hop was characterized by **flexible role-taking**, improvisational freedom, and authentic self-expression. The dance didn't care who led or followed based on gender. It cared about communication, creativity, and joy.

## How Lindy Hop Works

At its heart, lindy hop is a **conversation without words**. Two partners communicate through movement, responding to each other and to swing music's infectious rhythms. One person leads (initiates movements), the other follows (interprets and responds), but in queer lindy spaces like QSXZ, everyone learns both roles.

The dance is:
- **Improvisational** – No two dances are exactly the same
- **Playful** – Room for humor, creativity, and personal flair
- **Connected** – About listening and responding to your partner
- **Energetic** – Full of bouncy swing-outs, spins, and aerials
- **Accessible** – Beginners can start dancing from day one

## Why "Switch Dancing" Matters

Mainstream swing culture eventually codified leading as "masculine" and following as "feminine"—erasing the dance's original gender fluidity. **Queer lindy hop reclaims that radical history.**

At QSXZ, we practice "Everyone Leads, Everyone Follows" (ELEF). You'll learn both roles regardless of your gender identity. This isn't just social justice—it makes you a better dancer. Understanding both sides of the conversation deepens your artistry, expands your creative possibilities, and honors the dance's original spirit.

## The Global Evolution

Today, lindy hop is danced worldwide, from Seoul to Stockholm to São Paulo. While the dance has evolved and spread, its most vibrant spaces remember where it came from. Queer lindy exchanges around the globe are reconnecting with the dance's Black and queer heritage—not as a novelty, but as a homecoming.
