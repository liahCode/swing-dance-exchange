# What is Queerness?

When we say QSXZ is a "queer swing exchange," we mean something specific—and something joyful. Here's what queerness means in the context of our event.

## What Does "Queer" Mean?

At its simplest, "queer" is an umbrella term for people whose sexual orientation or gender identity falls outside what society expects. If you're not straight (heterosexual) or not cisgender (identifying with the gender you were assigned at birth), you might identify as queer. This includes lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, transgender, non-binary, genderfluid people—and many others whose experiences don't fit neatly into categories.

But "queer" is more than a checklist of identities. For many people, it's about **fluidity**—the freedom to not have your identity pinned down, to let it evolve over time, to resist labels that feel too narrow. For others, it's explicitly **political**: a way of challenging societal norms about gender, sexuality, relationships, and power. And for some, it's **cultural**—a connection to queer art, queer history, queer community, and queer ways of being in the world.

"Queer" was once used as a slur, and for some people—especially older generations who lived through that—it still carries pain. But it's been proudly reclaimed by many LGBTQ+ people as a word of empowerment, defiance, and joy. Not everyone in the LGBTQ+ community uses it, and that's completely okay. We use it at QSXZ because it's broad enough to welcome everyone, flexible enough to honor change, and political enough to be honest about the kind of space we're creating.

## On the Dance Floor: Everyone Leads, Everyone Follows

At its most practical, queer dancing means **swing dancing without assumed gender roles**. At QSXZ, everyone learns to lead and follow, regardless of gender identity. We ask about dance roles rather than assuming them. You might dance as a lead in one song and a follow in the next—or switch mid-dance. We call this role-switching or ELEF (Everyone Leads, Everyone Follows).

This isn't just about being progressive. It's about honoring how swing dancing actually began: as an improvisational art form where flexibility and creative expression mattered more than rigid rules.

## A Word Reclaimed

"Queer" has a complex history. In English, it was used as a slur before being proudly reclaimed by LGBTQ+ communities as an umbrella term for identities outside heteronormative expectations. We use "queer" intentionally because:

- It connects us to established queer dance communities across styles like tango, salsa, and folk dance
- It signals that traditional lindy hop often centers cisgender, heterosexual norms—and we're creating something different
- It reaches people who've felt shut out by mainstream dance scenes
- It's honest about our values: this is a space created **by and for** queer people, while warmly welcoming curious allies

## Honoring the History

The creators of early swing music were Black. The dancers of early lindy hop were Black. Many of them were also gay, lesbian, or trans. The Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s-30s saw queer and Black artists like Gladys Bentley, Ma Rainey, and Billy Strayhorn thriving in spaces like the Savoy Ballroom—spaces where the boundaries between leading and following, masculine and feminine expression, were far more fluid than the heteronormative narrative often suggests.

When we dance queer lindy hop, we're not changing swing dancing. **We're continuing a tradition that was always there.**

## Who This Space Is For

QSXZ is created by and for queer, trans, and gender non-conforming people. If you're part of the LGBTQ+ community, this event is for you—this is your space to dance without explanations, without adjusting yourself, without being the only one.

If you're cisgender and heterosexual, you're warmly welcomed as a guest in this queer space. We invite you to come with respect, openness, and a willingness to learn. Think of it as an opportunity to experience swing dancing from a perspective that challenges the norms you might take for granted.

## Beyond Identity: A Practice of Freedom

Ultimately, queerness at QSXZ isn't just about who you are—it's about how we dance together. It's the freedom to move authentically, to experiment with roles, to ask questions instead of making assumptions. It's choosing connection over convention, joy over judgment, and creating a dance floor where everyone belongs.

**Come as you are. Dance as you want. This is your invitation.**
