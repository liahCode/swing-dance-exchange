# Why a Queer Lindy Hop Exchange?

**Short answer?** Because swing dancing has always been queer, and it's time to reclaim that history. **Longer answer?** Read on.

## For Queer Dancers: You Belong Here

If you've ever felt like you had to translate yourself to fit into a dance space—if you've been misgendered, assumed into a role, or just craved a weekend where you could show up fully as yourself—**this is for you**.

QSXZ creates space where:
- Nobody assumes your dance role based on how you look
- You can explore leading, following, or switching without explanation
- Your pronouns are respected as naturally as asking your name
- The dance floor recognizes your full, complex humanity
- You're not the only queer person in the room

You won't find "ladies and gentlemen" here. You'll find chosen family, mutual recognition, and the joy of dancing without having to explain yourself first.

## For Switch Dancers & Role Explorers: Level Up Your Dance

**Here's something most people don't know**: Early lindy hop was radically flexible. Dancers switched roles, played with gender presentation, and created space for authentic expression. Then the dance got codified, commercialized, and straightened out.

QSXZ brings back that creative freedom.

**What you'll gain**:
- **Skill development**: Learning both roles makes you a better dancer, period. You'll understand connection, musicality, and improvisation from both sides
- **Creative challenge**: Switching mid-dance opens up entirely new possibilities for playfulness and musicality
- **Artistic growth**: Role-switching isn't just political—it's artistically enriching
- **Community**: Connect with international queer swing dancers who are pushing the boundaries of what lindy hop can be

We're not diluting swing dancing. We're returning it to its roots.

## For Non-Dancers & Pride Attendees: An Accessible Entry Point

**Never danced before?** Perfect. You're exactly who we want.

QSXZ happens during **Zürich Pride Weekend** because swing dancing and Pride share DNA—both are about claiming space, expressing yourself authentically, and celebrating collective joy. If you're in Zürich for Pride and curious about what a queer dance party looks like, we've got you.

**What to expect**:
- **Taster classes** designed for absolute beginners
- **No partner needed**—you'll rotate constantly, meeting new people
- **All roles open** to all people—experiment, play, find what feels good
- **Beyond dancing**: Drag performances, queer city tours, history talks, a Swing Drag Brunch, and integration with Pride Festival events

You don't need to be a dancer. You just need to be curious.

## Why Queer? Why Now? Why Zürich?

### The History You Weren't Taught

Lindy hop was born in Harlem in the 1920s-30s, created by Black Americans during the Harlem Renaissance. And here's the part that often gets left out: **many of those early dancers were queer**.

Gladys Bentley headlined at clubs in the early 1930s as an openly lesbian performer. Ma Rainey, Billy Strayhorn, Tony Jackson—the jazz world that birthed swing dancing was full of queer, lesbian, and gender non-conforming artists. The Savoy Ballroom wasn't just integrated racially; it was a space where gender and sexuality were fluid, creative, and celebrated.

We're not adding queerness to swing dancing. We're **honoring what was always there**.

### The Gap in Switzerland

Switzerland has a vibrant swing scene and a growing queer community, but until now, no event has brought them together intentionally. QSXZ is the **first queer swing exchange in Switzerland**—and we're doing it during Pride to make a statement about visibility, celebration, and belonging.

### Why Pride Weekend Matters

Timing QSXZ during Zürich Pride isn't a scheduling coincidence—it's a political and cultural choice. Pride is about refusing to hide, celebrating who we are, and building community across difference. That's exactly what we're doing on the dance floor.

Plus: **Pride Parade participation** (yes, we're dancing our way through it), integration with Pride Festival events, and a chance to explore Zürich's queer spaces with fellow dancers.

## What Makes QSXZ Different?

This isn't just another swing exchange with a rainbow flag slapped on it. Here's what sets us apart:

### 1. **Pride Integration**
We're not happening *near* Pride—we're *part of* Pride. Dance your way through the parade, then dance your way through the weekend.

### 2. **Multidisciplinary Programming**
Workshops, yes. Social dancing, absolutely. But also: voguing workshops, drag performances, queer history talks, pub crawls through Zürich's queer spaces, and a Swing Drag Brunch that you won't forget.

### 3. **Everyone Leads, Everyone Follows (ELEF)**
Role-switching isn't a side workshop—it's woven through everything we do. All classes teach both roles. All social dancing welcomes all roles. No assumptions, just possibilities.

### 4. **Intersectional & Accountable**
We know that queer spaces haven't always shown up for trans, non-binary, Black, and POC communities. We're committed to doing better—through our Code of Conduct, our Care Team, our accessibility commitments, and our recognition that if you're not Black, you're a guest in swing dance culture.

### 5. **Brave Space, Not Safe Space**
We can't guarantee safety—nobody can. But we *can* commit to active anti-racism, anti-homo/transphobia work, economic and physical accessibility, and a trained Care Team ready to support you. We're building this space together.

### 6. **Zürich as Destination**
Gorgeous city. Rich queer history. Stunning lake and mountains. Incredible food scene. And a local swing community excited to welcome you.

## Will It Be Perfect?

**No.**

Let's be honest: No queer space is without friction. No dance event gets everything right. You might encounter someone who doesn't get your pronouns on the first try. The music might skew too vintage or too modern for your taste. The workshops might be too easy or too hard.

What we *can* promise:
- **We'll try.** Hard. And we'll keep learning.
- **We have structures in place** (Code of Conduct, Care Team, accessibility commitments) to address harm when it happens
- **We center joy** while holding space for the messiness of being human together
- **We believe you belong here**, even when it's imperfect

The swing scene is more progressive than you might expect. It's not paradise, but it's pretty damn fun.

## Why You Should Come

Because **you deserve a weekend where**:
- You don't have to explain yourself
- Your body is celebrated, not policed
- You can try on different roles—in dance and in life
- You're surrounded by people who get it
- History is honored, not erased
- Joy is centered, not apologized for
- You leave with new skills, new friends, and renewed energy

Because **swing dancing at its best** is about communication without words, improvisation, playfulness, and connection. It's about two (or more) people creating something together that didn't exist before.

That's queer as hell. And it's beautiful.

**Come swing with us. Come switch with us. Come be yourself with us.**
