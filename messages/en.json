And a Café Crawl (Swiss thingy) where people also discuss queer topics? Auf dem Vorplatz, we should have a thingy on what it means to be queer, in general, but also, in the context of Lindy Hop. People may realize that they, too, are actually queer :)",
        "note4": "On Saturday, it should be possible to have a nice outdoor activity. Some sort of tour of Zurich, either from a queer perspective, or from a swing dance perspective, which could be cool. But also, the meetup the day before should be sufficient. Zürich is beautiful in summer, maybe go swimming? But then not everyone does that. It could be nice to have a drag brunch on Saturday, that would be cool, parallel with the Pride. And in the afternoon, a drag workshop. So we offer a brunch from 11:00 to 13:00, a drag brunch, and from 14:00 to 16:00, a drag workshop. Parallel, we have the tours, and probably some other activities. And we hold a masterclass for advanced dancers on switch dancing. Or it may make sense to reduce it to a 1 hour workshop :) And the party starts at like 20:00 then."
